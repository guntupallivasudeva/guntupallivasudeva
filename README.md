## 🌟 Summary

I'm **Guntupalli Vasudeva**, a dedicated **Cloud & DevOps Engineer** focused on automating infrastructure, securing deployments, and implementing cloud-native solutions that scale. I specialize in building resilient systems using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**, **CI/CD pipelines**, **container orchestration**, and **real-time monitoring**.

With hands-on experience across **AWS, Azure, and GCP**, I bring together the best of open-source tools and cloud services to streamline development workflows and improve system reliability. I'm passionate about scripting, automation, security, and all things DevOps.

I architect systems that are **scalable, secure, and reproducible** using tools like **Terraform, Ansible, Jenkins, and Docker**, and I deploy them using modern cloud-native platforms like **EKS, ECS**. My focus is on reducing human error, boosting team productivity, and shortening the software development lifecycle.

Whether it’s building secure pipelines, managing infrastructure as code, or setting up observability stacks with **Grafana, Prometheus**, I aim to deliver infrastructure that supports high availability, fault tolerance, and rapid innovation.

**Key Strengths:**

- 🔁 CI/CD Pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and Bitbucket Pipelines
- ☁️ Expertise in multi-cloud deployments with AWS, Azure, and GCP
- ⚙️ Proficient in container platforms like Docker and Kubernetes (EKS, AKS)
- 🔐 Deep understanding of IAM, VPC, firewalls, security groups, and cloud governance
- 📜 Infrastructure automation with Terraform, Ansible, and CloudFormation
- 📊 End-to-end monitoring with Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog, and ELK Stack
- 🔒 Cloud Security and compliance automation using best practices and tools like Trivy and Vault

I believe in **DevOps as culture**, not just a toolchain—where collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement drive engineering excellence.
